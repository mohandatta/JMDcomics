            <h1> Bats solute for ROB </h1>
            <p class="text">
                Once up on a time there was a boy named Robert. He lives in New york. He works in C.I.T solutions. C.I.T solutions was workin' on a project named Bat solute-1. This project's aim is to control bats. But, this experiment reversed. The chemical used in this project was accidentally leaked. After the leakage, every bat in the city came to the area in which the chemical was leaked. Scientists who worked on this project escaped from there leaving the bat behind on which they experimented. Robert came to lab for passing a notice of leave. Then he saw a group of bats trying to come near the experimented bat. Robert then took all the chemicals he found and went away from there. Previously, robert strongly believes zombies exist and built a stronghold. He went to that stronghold with those chemicals he took. He also catched a bat with life he experimented that bat with all chemicals he took. One of them worked and the bat became normal. But, he forgot to note the chemical name. <a href="inde2.html"><button class="btn btn1">Episode-2</button> </a> <br><br>
